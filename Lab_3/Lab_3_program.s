; The following lines are similar to Lab-1 but use a defined address to make it easier.
; They just turn off all LEDs 
				LDR			R10, =LED_BASE_ADR		; R10 is a permenant pointer to the base address for the LEDs, offset of 0x20 and 0x40 for the ports

				MOV 		R3, #0xB0000000		; Turn off three LEDs on port 1  
				STR 		R3, [r10, #0x20]
				MOV 		R3, #0x0000007C
				STR 		R3, [R10, #0x40] 	; Turn off five LEDs on port 2 

; This line is very important in your main program
; Initializes R11 to a 16-bit non-zero value and NOTHING else can write to R11 !!
				MOV			R11, #0xABCD		; Init the random number generator with a non-zero number

; R11 holds a 16-bit random number via a pseudo-random sequence as per the Linear feedback shift register (Fibonacci) on WikiPedia
; R11 holds a non-zero 16-bit number.  If a zero is fed in the pseudo-random sequence will stay stuck at 0
; Take as many bits of R11 as you need.  If you take the lowest 4 bits then you get a number between 1 and 15.
;   If you take bits 5..1 you'll get a number between 0 and 15 (assuming you right shift by 1 bit).
;
; R11 MUST be initialized to a non-zero 16-bit value at the start of the program OR ELSE!
; R11 can be read anywhere in the code but must only be written to by this subroutine

;               The formula to determine the number of loop cycles is equal to Clock speed x Delay time / (#clock cycles)
