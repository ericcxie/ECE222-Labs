# ECE 222 Labs

## Lab 1: Flashing LED

The objective of this lab is to complete, assemble and download a simple assembly language
program. Here is a short list of what you will do in this session:

- Write some THUMB assembly language instructions
- Use different memory addressing modes
- Test and debug the code on the Keil board

You will flash an LED (Light Emitting Diode) at an approximate 1 Hz frequency.

## Lab 2: Subroutines and parameter passing

In structured programming, big tasks are broken into small routines. A short program is written for
each routine. The main program calls these short subroutines.
In most cases when a subroutine is called, some information and parameters must be
communicated between the main program and the subroutine. This is called parameter passing.
In this lab, you will use subroutines and parameter passing by implementing a Morse code system.

## Lab 3: Input/Output interfacing

The objective of this lab is to learn how to use peripherals (LEDs, switch) connected to a
microprocessor. The ARM CPU is connected to the outside world using Ports and in this lab you
will setup, and use, Input and Output ports.

## Lab 4: Interrupt handling

The objective of this lab is to learn about interrupts. You will enable an interrupt source in the
LPC1768 microprocessor, and write an interrupt service routine (ISR) that is triggered when the
INT0 button is pressed. The ISR returns to the main program after handling the interrupt.
